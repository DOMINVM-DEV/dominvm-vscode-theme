# Dominvm VS Code Theme

A pair of carefully designed Light and Dark themes embracing the Dominvm color palette and best UI/UX practices.

## Recommended Settings

To match the design specifications, we recommend using one of the following fonts: **DM Mono** or **Courier New**. 
Since VS Code themes cannot override the font family automatically, you should update your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.fontFamily": "'DM Mono', 'Courier New', monospace"
}
```

## Features

- **Dominvm Light**: Uses a warm palette of Timberwolf, Taupe Mist, Palladian, and Warm White. Accented with Dominvm Brown and Rust.
- **Dominvm Dark**: A deep, rich palette of Dark Rosewood, Woodsmoke, and Dark Charcoal. Accented with Atomic Tangerine.

Enjoy a beautifully constructed environment for your next project!
